# Operating Systems 2021-2 (OS212)
## TIPS

1. Don't Skip Any Step<br>
Read the commands carefully in order, one by one. Don't miss any single command line.<br> 
Get in the habit of writing the command / code by yourself to understand the meaning of the command.

2. Do Demos<br>
Do the demo to understand more about the material, most likely it will be useful on the next week quiz

3. Do All The Previous MidTerm Problem<br>
Complete all available practice questions. Especially the previous midterm problem because the next quiz changes a bit from the exercises

4. Read Linux From Scratch Guide
Make sure you really read what's in the Linux From Scratch guide, so you don't get confused or have no idea about doing the assignment.

5. Watch Linux From Scratch Video Tutorial
Linux From Scratch tutorial videos made by Kernotex are very helpful for doing the last week assignments
